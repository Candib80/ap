# Summer Assignment 2020

Hello! I am happy to have you in my AP Computer Science Principles class for the 2020-2021 school year! Below is this year's summer assignment.  
I look forward to having you all in the fall, and have a great summer break! If you ever need me, email me at <cbeaman@parrottacademy.org>.\\

  - These 2 short videos explain CS50, and CS50 AP, which is what we use for our AP CSP here at APA
- Download the document(s) below and use them for Parts 1 & 2
  - *Guided Notes document(s) coming soon*

## Part 1
- Read Chapter 1 in *Invitation to Computer Science 8th ed.*
  - Either come by and pick up your book, or use the [PDF of Chapter 1](/ap/assets/pdfs/summer/inv-to-cs-ch1.pdf)
  - Complete the guided notes for the reading

## Part 2
- Second, look over the guided notes for all sections in Understanding Technology, as some answers may appear as you are going through other videos
- Complete the following for [Understanding Technology](/ap/curriculum/understanding_technology):
  - Hardware
  - Internet
  - Multimedia
- There are Notes, Reference Sheets, Videos, and Slides for all the above. Make sure to utilize all the materials to answer the guided notes for each of the sections
