# Summer Assignment 2020

Hello! I am happy to have you in my AP Computer Science Principles class for the 2020-2021 school year! Below is this year's summer assignment.  
I look forward to having you all in the fall, and have a great summer break! If you ever need me, email me at <cbeaman@parrottacademy.org>.\\

## Part 0
- First, make sure to watch the playlist on the [homepage on our CS50 AP Site]({{"/index" | relative_url}})
  - These 2 short videos explain CS50, and CS50 AP, which is what we use for our AP CSP here at APA
- Download the document(s) below and use them for Parts 1 & 2
  - *Guided Notes document(s) coming soon*

## Part 1
- Read selected pages from Chapter 1 in *Invitation to Computer Science 8th ed.*; [PDF here](\ap\assets\pdfs\summer\inv-to-cs-ch1-edited.pdf)
- Complete the guided notes for the reading

## Part 2
- Complete the following for [Understanding Technology](/ap/curriculum/understanding_technology):
  - Hardware - look over all the sections of Hardware in the Guided Notes before you start since answers can appear in different places as you read the notes or ref sheets or watch the video.
  - Internet
  - Multimedia
- There are Notes, Reference Sheets, Videos, and Slides for all the above. Make sure to utilize all the materials to answer the guided notes for each of the sections
- **DO NOT** do any of the Problems for the Hardware section, but do look over them as you may see something similar on the test
- **DO NOT** do the Security section of Understanding Technology; we will do this after school starts
