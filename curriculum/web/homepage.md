# Homepage

Build a simple homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Background

The internet has enabled incredible things: we can use a search engine to research anything imaginable, communicate with friends and family members around the globe, play games, take courses, and so much more. But it turns out that nearly all pages we may visit are built on three core languages, each of which serves a slightly different purpose:

1. HTML, or <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>, which is used to describe the content of websites;
1. CSS, <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>, which is used to describe the aesthetics of websites; and
1. JavaScript, which is used to make websites interactive and dynamic.

Create a simple homepage that introduces yourself, your favorite hobby or extracurricular, or anything else of interest to you.

## Getting Started

<p>Here’s how to download this problem’s “distribution code” (i.e., starter code) into your own CS50 IDE. Log into <a href="https://ide.cs50.io/">CS50 IDE</a> and then, in a terminal window, execute each of the below.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> to ensure that you’re in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/</code> (i.e., your home directory).</li>
  <li>Execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir pset8</code> to make (i.e., create) a directory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pset8</code> in your home directory.</li>
  <li>Execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd pset8</code> to change into (i.e., open) that directory.</li>
  <li>Execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2019/fall/tracks/web/homepage/homepage.zip</code> to download a (compressed) ZIP file with this problem’s distribution.</li>
  <li>Execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unzip homepage.zip</code> to uncompress that file.</li>
  <li>Execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm homepage.zip</code> followed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yes</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> to delete that ZIP file.</li>
  <li>Execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>. You should see a directory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homepage</code>, which was inside of that ZIP file.</li>
  <li>Execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd homepage</code> to change into that directory.</li>
  <li>Execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>. You should see this problem’s distribution, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">styles.css</code>.</li>
  <li>You can immediately start a server to view the site by running</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ http-server
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in the terminal window and clicking on the link that appears.</p>
