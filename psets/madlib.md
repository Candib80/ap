## Mad Lib

### tl;dr

Come up with a Mad Lib that you would like to implement using an array to store answers from your user then print out your story.

---

Come up with a short paragraph or two leaving blanks for at least one each: name, adjective, adverb, noun, and verb.  Feel free to add more blanks and to showcase your personality.  NO BAD LANGUAGE OR INAPPROPRIATE TOPICS!!

Inside of your `unit2` folder, create another folder named `madlib`. Inside this folder, create a file called `madlib.c`.

In this program you will, using the mad lib you wrote already, ask your user to enter the appropriate blanks you left in your story and store these in an array. After you have gotten all the information from the user, you will print the filled in mad lib to the screen.
