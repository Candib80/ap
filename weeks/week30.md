### Monday  
* Get caught up on anything you missed [last week](/ap/weeks/week29), and get it turned in, unless you have spoken to me about it already. I will have a week overview video for you guys up tomorrow morning, but in the meantime, be planning out your Create Task (what you want to accomplish with your program, what language, if your idea is to much for your current skills, etc.)
