### Monday  
* Get caught up on anything you missed [last week](/ap/weeks/week29), and get it turned in, unless you have spoken to me about it already. I will have a week overview video for you guys up tomorrow morning, but in the meantime, be planning out your Create Task (what you want to accomplish with your program, what language, if your idea is to much for your current skills, etc.)
* I have updated homework grades to reflect work submitted from the last 2 weeks. Each day was one point, so if you turned in all 3 assignments on the first week, you got 3 points, if you missed one, you got 2 points. The first week counted at 1/2 credit, and last week was full credit. If you missed an assignment, you can still turn it in and I will accept it with no points taken off so long as you get them turned in tomorrow at midnight! Also, if you have no grade for last week's assignments (worth a total of 4 points), it's because you hadn't done them and I didn't want to make your grade worse.

### Tuesday  
* I have created and distributed a **Create Journal** page in your OneNote Class Notebooks to keep up with how your task is coming along.
