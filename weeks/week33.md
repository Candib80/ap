## Week 33  
Week of 4/20/2020  

**Your Create Task is due to the College Board, marked as final, by May 18th to ensure I have time to look over everything and grade it.**  
* This will count as two (2) PSETs
* I have set this due date to ensure everyone turns it in to CB on time. Their due date is May 26, and they DO NOT accept anything late!

* Make sure to complete at least one journal entry by Friday at 11:59pm to get credit for this week
* A link to the written response template can now be found on the [Create Task Page](/ap/units/pt/create) in the [Resources](/ap/units/pt/create/#resources) section on the bottom
* A video on how to record will be up later today or tomorrow (I have to go to school for that to use the Internet)
