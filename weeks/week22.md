### Tuesday Homework
* Create a folder in your `chapter6` folder called `homework`
* Inside the `homework` folder, create a file called `hw1.py`
* In `hw1.py` write a program that does the following:
  * Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. *Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?*
* For extra credit on your HW grade:
  1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
  2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it `num`) and one number to divide by (`check`). If `check` divides evenly into `num`, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
* Make sure to check your program by running it before you turn it in.
  * To run your program execute the below in the terminal window
```
cd chapter6/homework
python hw1.py
```
* To submit `hw1.py`, execute the below in the terminal window, logging in with your GitHub username and password when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your password.
