### If you missed any journal entries, work on Create this week and make some entries and I will count them for you :smiley:

* [Sign up for any meetings with me that you need](https://calendly.com/candib-apa/create-task)
* [Create Task Page](/ap/units/pt/create)
* [Link to sample responses on College Board for Create](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam?course=ap-computer-science-principles) - scroll down until you see **Scoring Guidelines and Notes for the 2019 Exam Administration**
* Details on how to video everything and the template for the written responses will be out next week. (I forgot this was Spring Break, so I will have out for you this weekend so you can get started on it next week)
