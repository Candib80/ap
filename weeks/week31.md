### If you missed last week's journal entry, you need schedule a Zoom meeting with me (link is above), and we can talk about what you need to get going on your Create Task. I don't want to give you zero's for your work, but I have to have something to go off of for grades, and the journal entries were the best way I could think of. With them, I know where you stand, and can check off that you are continuing to work on it. The sooner you guys get Create done, the sooner we can be finished.
