### Monday  
* We have talked about what Big Data is, but now we need to take a look at the data itself and figure out how to work with it. Read the [Analyzing Data Notes](/ap/curriculum/data_science/analyzing_data/notes/) online to learn about getting data ready and gathering information from said data.
* Work on the Exploring Trends assignment in Teams (remember to use your APA email to log in if you have gotten logged out)
* After you have completed the assignment, go to [Unit 4, Lesson 2 in Code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2019/stage/2/puzzle/1?section_id=2525239) and answer the **4** questions in Check Your Understanding if you didn't do them by accident last week

### Tuesday  
* This should be up by Monday night
