### Monday  
* We have talked about what Big Data is, but now we need to take a look at the data itself and figure out how to work with it. Read the [Analyzing Data Notes](/ap/curriculum/data_science/analyzing_data/notes/) online to learn about getting data ready and gathering information from said data.
* Work on the Exploring Trends assignment in Teams (remember to use your APA email to log in if you have gotten logged out)
* After you have completed the assignment, go to [Unit 4, Lesson 2 in Code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2019/stage/2/puzzle/1?section_id=2525239) and answer the **4** questions in Check Your Understanding if you didn't do them by accident last week

### Tuesday  
* Read *Connecting the Dots* section of the book [Blown to Bits (linked here)](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf), starting on page 32 through page 35
* Then head over to Teams and complete the assignment to go along with the reading (will be posted up first thing Tues morning); this will be due Friday
* There will also be a discussion in the [Q4 channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a73fa7b85ae134551873abf47c88be3a4%40thread.skype/Q4%2520-%2520Data%2520Science%2520and%2520Impact%2520of%2520Computing?groupId=d53e228c-3a1a-4789-b122-bf4cbeee01f5&tenantId=bb0d39a7-51ab-4b2a-b2a5-2892b0361a99) that you will need to post at least one response to by **Tuesday night at midnight**; again, this will be up first thing Tues morning.
