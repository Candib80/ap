**Looking forward:** Start on [Chapter 3](curriculum/3)

**Anything not completed in class becomes homework**
  - *HW Assignments not submitted by class time next day will be late and you will not get points*
  - *PSETs not turned in will be counted off 5 points/percent each day they are late*
  - *Labs will be included in the Quizzes Category and graded as such*
