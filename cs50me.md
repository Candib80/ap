# CS50.me

This is where you will go to check your submissions.

CS50 automatically grades your C programs for correctness and other parameters, and you can go here to see your grades before they are officially graded. 

If you want to redo a submission before the due date to get a higher grade you are more than welcome to do so.

Before we can start submitting programs here, you will need to join the class.  To do so, please go to cs50.me once and authenticate with your GitHub account. 

After you have visited this site once, please go to the link below to join the class.  You only have to do this once and after this, you will only need to go to cs50.me going forward.
