# Performance Task: Explore - Impact of Compting Innovations

## Overview

Computing innovations impact our lives in ways that require considerable study and reflection for us to fully understand them. In this performance task, you will explore a computing innovation of your choice. **A computing innovation is an innovation that includes a computer or program code as an integral part of its functionality.** Your close examination of this computing innovation will deepen your understanding of computer science principles.

## General Requirements

**This performance task requires you to select and investigate a computational innovation to:**  
* analyze a computing innovations impact on society, economy, or culture and explain who this impact could be beneficial and/or harmful;
* explain how a computing innovation consumes, produces, or transforms data; and
* describe how data storage, data privacy, or data security concerns are raised based on the capabilities of the computing innovation.

**You are also required to:**  
* investigate your computing innovation using a variety of sources (print, online, expert interviews);
* provide in-text citations of at least three different sources that helped you create your computational artifact and/or formulate your written responses;
    * At least 2 of the sources must be available online or in print; your third source may be either online, in print, or a personal interview with an expert on the computing innovation
    * At least 2 of the sources must have been created after the end of the previous academic year
* produce a computational artifact that illustrates, represents, or explains the computing innovation's intended purpose, its function, or its effect; and
* provide written responses to all the prompts in the performance task about your computational artifact and computing innovation.
