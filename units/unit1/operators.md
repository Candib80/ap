## Operators

In addition to having operators that perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, C also has operators that perform other functions: like finding the remainder when dividing, or updating the value of a variable. C's arithmetic operators perform mathematical functions on numbers. The `+` operator adds two numbers, the `-` operator subtracts one number from another, the `*` operator multiplies two numbers, and the `/` symbol divides one number by another. C also provides assignment operators, which provide a variety of ways to update the value of a variable.

- ### Thought Questions
  - How do operators in C compare to operators in math? Do they always translate to the same thing?
  - Why is there a difference between integer division and float division?
  - Why is modulo (`%`) a built in operation?
  - What are some problems where modulo might come in handy? What about integer division?
  - What are `x++`, `x--`, `+=`, and `*=` shorthand for?
