# Summer Assignment 2019

Hello! I am happy to have you in my AP Computer Science Principles class for the 2019-2020 school year! Below is this year's summer assignment.\\
**There will be a test the first week of school** on material covered in the assignment, however, we will review some before.\\
I look forward to having you all in the fall, and have a great summer break! If you ever need me, email me at <cbeaman@parrottacademy.org>.\\

[Guided Notes Handout]({{"/assets/pdfs/summer/summer-2019.pdf" | relative_url}}) - feel free to take additional notes on notebook paper if you need to. This will count as a quiz grade (quizzes count for 10% of your grade).
[Supplementary Notes]({{"/assets/pdfs/summer/unit0-study.pdf" | relative_url}}) - You do not HAVE to do this, but it was the study guide for Unit 0 last year.

## Part I
- Read Chapter 1 in *Invitation to Computer Science 8th ed.*
  - Either come by and pick up your book, or use the [PDF of Chapter 1]({{"/assets/pdfs/summer/inv-to-cs-ch1.pdf" | relative_url}})
  - Complete the guided notes for the reading

## Part II
- First, make sure to watch the playlist on the [homepage on our CS50 AP Site]({{"/index" | relative_url}})
- Complete the following for [Unit 0]({{ "/units/unit0" | relative_url }}):\\
*Most of the information for How Computers Work through Memory, can be found in the long lecture video in How Computers Work. I know this may seem like a lot, but it all goes together and I think you will find it more manageable than you think. Just make sure to give yourself enough time to watch everything and complete the notes.*

  - [Computers and Computing]({{"/units/unit0/computers_and_computing" | relative_url }})
