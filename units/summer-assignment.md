# Summer Assignment 2019

Hello! I am happy to have you in my AP Computer Science Principles class for the 2019-2020 school year! Below is an overview of this year's summer assignment. I will post up more details by mid to end of June, but the online portion may be up a bit later as Harvard is likely to change a little of the curriculum (besides, that part should be done closer to start of school anyway so you can remember it).

I look forward to having you all in the fall, and have a great summer break! If you ever need me, email me at <cbeaman@parrottacademy.org>. ~Mrs. Beaman

We will be using *Invitation to Computer Science 8th ed.* this year to supplement our CS50 AP curriculum. With that your summer assignment will include some reading from the textbook along  with some online work from the CS50 AP curriculum. I will try to have a PDF of the book summer reading online, but you may also come by the school and get your assigned textbook if you would prefer to have the book ahead of time. Please do NOT stress out about most of the stuff in the book, as it is a college textbook for computer science, and as such, has a lot of material and terms that we will not be covering in this class. We will skip around in the book throughout the year, so don't think you can read ahead in it.
